# Hello_World
A storage box for code I create or feel like exposing to public scrutiny. Some of this will also be used as a portfolio.

My name is Stefan, I am trying to get into the world of coding. I have opted to start with C++, I took some lessons back in school but the classes got cancelled due to not enough intrest. I have signed up for and intend to complete a Bachelors Degree in computing and IT (software) part time. I have a family and a full time job. So I will only be coding or practicing for short periods most days. 

I am more than open to any criticism people have and more than happy to discuss anything, particularly if it will be of benefit to me in my learning.
